## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
*   PHP (>= 8.1)
*   Composer
*   Node.js & NPM
*   A web server (like Nginx or Apache, though `php artisan serve` is often sufficient for development)
*   A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    # Replace with your actual repository URL
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
2.  **Install PHP dependencies**
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Install NPM dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Create and configure your environment file**
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open `.env` and set your database connection details (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`) and any other necessary environment variables.
5.  **Generate application key**
    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
6.  **Run database migrations**
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate
    ```
7.  **(Optional) Seed the database**
    If your project has seeders to populate initial data:
    ```sh
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
8.  **Build frontend assets**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    (For development. For production, use `npm run build`)
9.  **Start the development server**
    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or another port if specified).
